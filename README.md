# Timed Quiz Challenge
By Jake Smith

## Project Information
The goal of this project was to completely code, from scratch, a timed web quiz that saved high scores locally. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a finished product.
By going through this process, it became much clearer to me how all three technologies work together to make one whole product. The user, by clicking the start button,
will then be prompted several multiple-choice questions to answer, while a timer ticks down from 45 seconds the whole time. In the end, a score is calculated based on correct
answers and time left, and then after entering their initials, the user's score is saved on a seperate highscores page.
